Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
N/A
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
1-3 PM on Sunday. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
For me Java is a bit more difficult as it is my first time working with the language and I'm getting used to the syntax of it. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
In programming there are many languages but using your knowledge of one language can help you in learning another one. For example when it comes to printing something in python you just say "print" but in Java you need to do "system.out.println". It is more specific when it comes to Java but if you understand how to print in python you can figure out how to print in Java.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
When asking the user to enter the amount of rounds that worked in the first try. But when it came for the back and forth conversation I tried to do it manual but that didn't work as it takes too long and its just unefficient. So I tried to use a for loop which I believe to be more efficient. Don't stay stuck on the same problem for too long. If you know how to attempt or do another part of the assignment go for that first.
